                <h3>How to play:</h3>
                <p>Choose one of three levels: easy, medium or hard and press the start button. Cards will appear
                    onscreen. The easy level will reveal eight cards, the medium level will reveal twelve cards and the
                    harder level will reveal sixteen cards.
                    The game consists of finding various pairs of cards, hidden underneath the questionmarked cards. The
                    aim is to find all the pairs by flipping the questionmarked cards before the time runs out. No more
                    than two cards can be flipped at any time. Once two similar cards are found, the pair will remain
                    shown leaving only the balance of the hidden cards to be flipped. If all the pairs are found before
                    the timer runs
                    out, the player won the level. If all the pairs have not been found before the timer runs out, the
                    player may start another game by choosing one of the three levels indicated at the top of the
                    screen. Pressing the start button will start the timer and thus a new game. If at any time the
                    player needs to leave the game (for a cup of tea or the doorbell ringing...), the stop button can be
                    pressed.
                    This will enable the player to start another game. The stop button may also be pressed if the player
                    found all the pairs before the timer runs out. The player can then again choose another game / level
                    and continue..... Good luck and have fun!
